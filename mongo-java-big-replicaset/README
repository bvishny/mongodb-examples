About
=======================================

A simple Mongo replica set setup example using Mongo/Java/Ant.

See: http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Replica+Sets

Prerequisites
=======================================

You must have Ant installed and in your $PATH.

You must have Mongo installed and the bin files in your $PATH.

Running
=======================================

Open three terminal windows and run one command in each:

ant mongo0
ant mongo1
ant arbiter0

This runs three instances of Mongo on your machine on ports 27017, 27018 and 27019.

In another terminal run:

ant run

This command will initialize your replica set and run a couple of simple tests. This command
takes a while to run because it waits for 30 seconds to make sure the replica set is OK.

Note: If you run "ant clean" this deletes the temp database files stored in build/*.

Note: This was last tested with 2.0.0.
